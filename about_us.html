It believes in providing customized/tailor made solutions with optimum space utilization rather than standard size product unlike the brands available in the market, where in the customer need to compromise with the availability. The organisation not only designs/provide consultation services but also executes the same.

			As the organization stabilized & with growing demand manual execution of works couldn’t be done. Hence to reach goals the organization setup a modular furniture manufacturing facilty in 2008. This was also done as the market demanded products of higher quality & variants in finishes with a line of machineries.

		<p>
			To execute & handle projects, The Opal Designers has in-house facility for manufacturing of ready to assemble furniture along with skilled & large work force for onsite works for executing the same to deliver the projects on schedule.
		</p>

		<p>
			To add to this facility a new line of art state of machineries was installed with panel processing & post forming facility bringing in a new revolution in the region. In 2010 looking in to the demand for the products & improvising of quality, efficiency & speeding up the productivity few more high productivity Imported machineries were installed. Again with the consistent  demand for the product the organization shifted to a larger space of 10,000sft for manufacturing & much more accessible for the clients with exposure & live demonstration to the product  with a large showroom space of around 4000sft all under one roof. With this the customer can have display, get designed there product, select material with quality and colors and visually see the production of there requirement.

 		<h2>Management Profile</h2>

 		<p>
			The Opal Designers was started by H.I Pinjar,in 2004. He hails properly from Bagalkot, but was born in Belgaum, when his father was in  Air Force, & later had his education in Bangalore and Tumkur. He has completed his Diploma in Mechanical Engineering & has graduated in Civil engineering. He has the exposure to the industrial culture while he studied his high school itself, when the family had industries in Tumkur one manufacturing Watch glass & parts for H.M.T, Titans & Bifora Watch industries & the other unit was manufacturing plastic Bangles catering to the various customers in Karnataka & parts of Maharashtra & Andhra Pradesh. While studying in high school he traveled along with his father to all the places for marketing & for procuring of raw materials. After his education he took over the industries & handled the same independently. Later, in 1988 the family started educational institution in the city of Dharwad & was forced to wind up the industries in Tumkur to look after the new business  enterprise at Dharwad. The family has an education Society which runs English & Kannada medium school & industrial Training institutes, off late has started residential school. 
		</p>

		<p>
			But, in 2004 the entrepreneur had difference within the family & was forced to come out of the family &  at this point of time he started this organization in shimoga. He started with designing, planning, providing consultancy & supervision of civil projects for both commercial & residential projects. He found that there was lot of scope for interiors as there were no professionals handling & executing the same. Then he took up seriously the job & has occupied the vacuum space of designing & executing of the projects on turnkey basis. He has earned a name not only in Shimoga but also in the neighboring cities & districts. He is handling projects at Shimoga, Chikkamalur, Davanagere, Chitradurga, Tumkur, Bangalore, Haveri  & even up to Hubli & Goa.

		<h2>Proposal & need for expansion</h2>

		<p>
			After starting of The Opal Designers in the year 2004, the organization has been in a process of continuously expanding its capability & capacity to meet to the need of the customer starting from a very small pace with manually done furniture to the state of the art facility. Now the need of the situation is that in this ongoing process the market is expanding with the volume of business opportunities & demand for newer products. The Opal Designers  is also to stay with the market & to grow itself with the latest technology, products, increase its productivity , efficiency, lesser dependency on human skill, the organization has decided on to go with adding of new & improvised machineries, for introducing new products, reducing  the cost of production , reducing the dependency on skilled labour.
		</p>

		<p>
			Presently new products for the interiors are the digital printing on furniture, Glass, Fabric & tiles. Hence, to cope & cater to the need of the customer, the unit is expanding this facility as there is not any other facility is Karnataka itself. It would be a right option to grab the opportunity before other Competitors arise to the market.
